      "Done.\n",
      "Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brush off the great bulk of the shaving and hand Stephen the hat and ashplant and buck him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion , which he very badly need . His ( Stephen 's ) mind be not exactly what you would call wander but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom , in view of the hour it be and there be no pump of Vartry water available for their ablution , let alone drinking purpose , hit upon an expedient by suggest , off the reel , the propriety of the cabman 's shelter , a it be call , hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge , where they might hit upon some drinkable in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral . But how to get there be the rub . For the nonce he be rather nonplussed but inasmuch a the duty plainly devolve upon him to take some measure on the subject he ponder suitable way and mean during which Stephen repeatedly yawn . So far a he could see he be rather pale in the face so that it occur to him a highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition , both of them be e. d. ed , particularly Stephen , always assume that there be such a thing to be find . Accordingly , after a few such preliminary , a , in spite of his have forget to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it have do yeoman service in the shaving line , brush , they both walk together along Beaver street , or , more properly , lane , as far a the farrier 's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stable at the corner of Montgomery street where they make track to the left from thence debouch into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin 's . But , a he confidently anticipate , there be not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be see except a fourwheeler , probably engage by some fellow inside on the spree , outside the North Star Hotel and there be no symptom of it budge a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom , who be anything but a professional whistler , endeavour to hail it by emit a kind of a whistle , hold his arm arch over his head , twice . This be a quandary but , bring commonsense to bear on it , evidently there be nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly do . So , bevel around by Mullet 's and the Signal House , which they shortly reach , they proceed perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus , Mr Bloom be handicap by the circumstance that one of the back button of his trouser have , to vary the timehonoured adage , go the way of all button , though , enter thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically make light of the mischance . So , a neither of them be particularly press for time , a it happen , and the temperature refresh since it clear up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius , they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle be wait without a fare or a jarvey . As it so happen a Dublin United Tramways Company 's sandstrewer happening to be return the elder man recount to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back . They pass the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station , the starting point for Belfast , where of course all traffic be suspend at that late hour , and , pass the back door of the morgue ( a not very entice locality , not to say gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) , ultimately gain the Dock Tavern and in due course turn into Store street , famous for it C division police station . Between this point and the high , at present unlit , warehouse of Beresford Place Stephen think to think of Ibsen , associate with Baird 's , the stonecutter 's , in his mind somehow in Talbot Place , first turn on the right , while the other , who be act a his fidus Achates , inhale with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke 's city bakery , situate quite close to where they be , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodity of the public the primary and most indispensable . Bread , the staff of life , earn your bread , O tell me where be fancy bread ? At Rourke 's the baker 's , it be say . En route , to his taciturn , and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion , Mr Bloom , who at all event , be in complete possession of his faculty , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , speak a word of caution re the danger of nighttown , woman of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while , though not a a habitual practice , be of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellow of his age particularly if they have acquire drink habit under the influence of liquor unless you know a little juijitsu for every contingency a even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you do n't look out . Highly providential be the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen be blissfully unconscious that , but for that man in the gap turn up at the eleventh hour , the finis might have be that he might have be a candidate for the accident ward , or , fail that , the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias , or , he be the solicitor , rather old Wall , he mean to say , or Malony which simply spell ruin for a chap when it get bruit about . The reason he mention the fact be that a lot of those policeman , whom he cordially dislike , be admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and , a Mr Bloom put it , recall a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street , prepare to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot . Never on the spot when want but in quiet part of the City , Pembroke Road , for example , the guardian of the law be well in evidence , the obvious reason be they be pay to protect the upper class . Another thing he comment on be equip soldier with firearm or sidearms of any description , liable to go off at any time , which be tantamount to incite them against civilian should by any chance they fall nut over anything . You fritter away your time , he very sensibly maintain , and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing , fast woman of the demimonde run away with a lot of # . s. d. into the bargain and the great danger of all be who you get drunk with though , touch the much vexed question of stimulant , he relish a glass of choice old wine in season a both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtue ( notably a good burgundy which he be a staunch believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably draw the line a it simply lead to trouble all round to say nothing of your be at the tender mercy of others practically . Most of all he comment adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one , a most glaring piece of rat on the part of his brother medico under all the circs . —And that one be Judas , say Stephen , who up to then have say nothing whatsoever of any kind . Discussing these and kindred topic they make a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and pass under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox , or something like one , attract their rather lagging footstep . Stephen of his own accord stop for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestone and by the light emanate from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox . He begin to remember that this have happen , or have be mention a have happen , before but it cost him no small effort before he remember that he recognise in the sentry a quondam friend of his father 's Gumley . To avoid a meeting be draw nearer to the pillar of the railway bridge . —Someone salute you , Mr Bloom say . A figure of middle height on the prowl , evidently , under the arch salute again , call : Night ! Stephen , of course , start rather dizzily and stop to return the compliment . Mr Bloom , actuate by motif of inherent delicacy , inasmuch a he always believe in mind his own business , move off but nevertheless remain on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least . Although unusual in the Dublin area , he know that it be not by any mean unknown for desperado who have next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorise peaceable pedestrian by place a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famish loiterer of the Thames embankment category they might be hang about there or simply marauder ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment notice , your money or your life , leave you there to point a moral , gag and garotte . Stephen , that be when the accosting figure come to close quarter , though he be not in any over sober state himself , recognise Corley 's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice . Lord John Corley , some call him , and his genealogy come about in this wise . He be the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division , lately decease , who have marry a certain Katherine Brophy , the daughter of a Louth farmer . His grandfather , Patrick Michael Corley , of New Ross , have marry the widow of a publican there whose maiden name have be Katherine ( also ) Talbot . Rumour have it , though not prove , that she descend from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of it kind and well worth see , his mother or aunt or some relative have enjoy the distinction of be in service in the washkitchen . This , therefore , be the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now address Stephen be speak of by some with facetious proclivity a Lord John Corley . Taking Stephen on one side he have the customary doleful ditty to tell . Not as much a a farthing to purchase a night 's lodging . His friend have all desert him . Furthermore , he have a row with Lenehan and call him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expression . He be out of a job and implore of Stephen to tell him where on God 's earth he could get something , anything at all to do . No , it be the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that be fostersister to the heir of the house or else they be connect through the mother in some way , both occurrence happen at the same time if the whole thing be n't a complete fabrication from start to finish . Anyhow , he be ill in . —I would n't ask you , only , pursue he , on my solemn oath and God know I 'm on the rock . —There 'll be a job tomorrow or the next day , Stephen tell him , in a boy ' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher . Mr Garret Deasy . Try it . You may mention my name . —Ah , God , Corley reply , sure I could n't teach in a school , man . I be never one of your bright one , he add with a half laugh . Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers . —I have no place to sleep myself , Stephen inform him . Corley , at the first go-off , be incline to suspect it be something to do with Stephen be fire out of his dig for bring in a bloody tart off the street . There be a dosshouse in Marlborough street , Mrs Maloney 's , but it be only a tanner touch and full of undesirable but M'Conachie tell him you get a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street ( which be distantly suggestive to the person address of friar Bacon ) for a bob . He be starve too though he have n't say a word about it . Though this sort of thing go on every other night or very near it still Stephen 's feeling get the good of him in a sense though he know that Corley 's brandnew rigmarole , on a par with the others , be hardly deserve of much credence . However , haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco , etcetera , a the Latin poet remark , especially a luck would have it he get pay his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which be the date of the month a a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal be demolish . But the cream of the joke be nothing would get it Out of Corley 's head that he be live in affluence and have n't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas . He put his hand in a pocket anyhow , not with the idea of find any food there , but think he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all event and get sufficient to eat . But the result be in the negative for , to his chagrin , he find his cash miss . A few broken biscuit be all the result of his investigation . He try his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he have lose , as well he might have , or leave , because in that contingency it be not a pleasant lookout , very much the reverse , in fact . He be altogether too fag out to institute a thorough search though he try to recollect about biscuit he dimly remember . Who now exactly give them , or where be , or do he buy ? However , in another pocket he come across what he surmise in the dark be penny , erroneously , however , a it turn out . —Those be halfcrowns , man , Corley correct him . And so in point of fact they turn out to be . Stephen lend him one of them . —Thanks , Corley answer . You 're a gentleman . I 'll pay you back some time . Who 's that with you ? I saw him a few time in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker . You might put in a good word for u to get me take on there . I 'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office tell me they 're full up for the next three week , man . God , you 've to book ahead , man , you 'd think it be for the Carl Rosa . I do n't give a shite anyway so long a I get a job even a a cross sweeper . Subsequently , be not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he get , he inform Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he say Stephen knew well out of Fullam 's , the shipchandler 's bookkeeper there , that use to be often round in Nagle 's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe . Anyhow , he be lag the night before last and fin ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refuse to go with the constable . Mr Bloom in the meanwhile keep dodge about in the vicinity of the cobblestone near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman 's sentrybox , who , evidently a glutton for work , it strike him , be have a quiet forty wink for all intent and purpose on his own private account while Dublin sleep . He throw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen 's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor a if he have see that nobleman somewhere or other though where he be not in a position to truthfully state nor have he the remote idea when . Being a levelheaded individual who could give point to not a few in point of shrewd observation , he also remark on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wear apparel generally , testify to a chronic impecuniosity . Probably he be one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it be merely a question of one prey on his next door neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deep depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chance to be in the dock himself penal servitude , with or without the option of a fine , would be a very rara avis altogether . In any case he have a consummate amount of cool assurance intercept people at that hour of the night or morning . Pretty thick that be certainly . The pair part company and Stephen rejoin Mr Bloom , who , with his practised eye , be not without perceive that he have succumb to the blandiloquence of the other parasite . Alluding to the encounter he say , laughingly , Stephen , that be : —He 's down on his luck . He ask me to ask you to ask somebody name Boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job a a sandwichman . At this intelligence , in which he seemingly evince little interest , Mr Bloom gaze abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger , rejoice in the farfamed name of Eblana , moor alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair , whereupon he observe evasively : —Everybody get their own ration of luck , they say . Now you mention it his face be familiar to me . But leave that for the moment , how much do you part with , he query , if I be not too inquisitive ? —Half-a-crown , Stephen respond . I daresay he need it to sleep somewhere . —Needs , Mr Bloom ejaculate , profess not the least surprise at the intelligence , I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably do . Everyone accord to his need and everyone accord to his deed . But talk about thing in general , where , add he with a smile , will you sleep yourself ? Walking to Sandycove be Out of the question and , even suppose you do , you wo n't get in after what occur at Westland Row station . Simply fag out there for nothing . I do n't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slight degree but why do you leave your father 's house ? —To seek misfortune , be Stephen 's answer . —I meet your respected father on a recent occasion , Mr Bloom diplomatically return . Today , in fact , or , to be strictly accurate , on yesterday . Where do he live at present ? I gather in the course of conversation that he have move . —I believe he be in Dublin somewhere , Stephen answer unconcernedly . Why ? —A gift man , Mr Bloom say of Mr Dedalus senior , in more respect than one and a born raconteur if ever there be one . He take great pride , quite legitimately , Out of you . You could go back , perhaps , he hazard , still think of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it be perfectly evident that the other two , Mulligan , that be , and that English tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , be patently try , a if the whole bally station belong to them , to give Stephen the slip in the confusion . There be no response forthcoming to the suggestion , however , such a it be , Stephen 's mind 's eye be too busily engage in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it , with his sister , Dilly , sit by the ingle , her hair hang down , wait for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that be in the sootcoated kettle to be do so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herring they have eat at two a penny , with an egg apiece for Maggy , Boody and Katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devour a mess of eggshell and char fish head and bone on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the day command , it be quarter tense or , if not , ember day or something like that . —No , Mr Bloom repeat again , I would n't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contribute the humorous element , Dr Mulligan , a a guide , philosopher , and friend , if I be in your shoe . He know which side his bread be butter on though in all probability he never realise what it be to be without regular meal . Of course you do n't notice as much a I do but it would n't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic be put in your drink for some ulterior object . He understand , however , from all he hear , that Dr Mulligan be a versatile allround man , by no mean confine to medicine only , who be rapidly come to the fore in his line and , if the report be verify , bid fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future a a tony medical practitioner draw a handsome fee for his service in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries , or Malahide be it ? be , he be bind to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he be utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple . —Except it simply amount to one thing and he be what they call pick your brain , he venture to throw out . The guarded glance of half solicitude , half curiosity , augment by friendliness , which he give at Stephen 's at present morose expression of feature do not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact , on the problem a to whether he have let himself be badly bamboozle , to judge by two or three low spirit remark he let drop , or , the other way about , saw through the affair , and , for some reason or other best know to himself , allow matter to more or less ... Grinding poverty do have that effect and he more than conjecture that , high educational ability though he possess , he experience no little difficulty in make both ends meet . Adjacent to the men 's public urinal he perceive an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heat altercation be get rid of voluble expression in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way , there be some little difference between the party . —Putana madonna , che ci dia i quattrini ! Ho ragione ? Culo rotto ! —Intendiamoci . Mezzo sovrano più —Dice lui , pero . —Farabutto ! Mortacci sui ! Mr Bloom and Stephen enter the cabman 's shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he have rarely , if ever , be before ; the former have previously whisper to the latter a few hint anent the keeper of it , say to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat , Fitzharris , the invincible , though he would n't vouch for the actual fact , which quite possibly there be not one vestige of truth in . A few moment later saw our two noctambules safely seat in a discreet corner , only to be greet by stare from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waif and stray and other nondescript specimen of the genus homo , already there engage in eating and drinking , diversify by conversation , for whom they seemingly form an object of marked curiosity . —Now touch a cup of coffee , Mr Bloom venture to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occur to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say a roll of some description . Accordingly his first act be with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodity quietly . The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedore , or whatever they be , after a cursory examination , turn their eye , apparently dissatisfy , away , though one redbearded bibulous individual , a portion of whose hair be greyish , a sailor , probably , still star for some appreciable time before transfer his rapt attention to the floor . Mr Bloom , avail himself of the right of free speech , he have just a bow acquaintance with the language in dispute though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over voglio , remark to his protégé in an audible tone of voice , apropos of the battle royal in the street which be still rag fast and furious : —Beautiful language . I mean for singing purpose . Why do you not write your poetry in that language ? Bella Poetria ! it be so melodious and full . Belladonna voglio . Stephen , who be try his dead best to yawn , if he could , suffer from dead lassitude generally , reply : —To fill the ear of a cow elephant . They be haggle over money . —Is that so ? Mr Bloom ask . Of course , he subjoin pensively , at the inward reflection of there be more language to start with than be absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that surround it . The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-à-tête put a boiling swim cup of a choice concoction label coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seem , after which he beat a retreat to his counter . Mr Bloom determine to have a good square look at him later on so a not to appear to ... for which reason he encourage Stephen to proceed with his eye while he do the honour by surreptitiously push the cup of what be temporarily suppose to be call coffee gradually nearer him . —Sounds be imposture , Stephen say after a pause of some little time . Like name , Cicero , Podmore , Napoleon , Mr Goodbody , Jesus , Mr Doyle . Shakespeares be as common a Murphies . What 's in a name ? —Yes , to be sure , Mr Bloom unaffectedly concur . Of course . Our name be change too , he add , push the socalled roll across . The redbearded sailor , who have his weather eye on the newcomer , board Stephen , whom he have single out for attention in particular , squarely by ask : —And what might your name be ? Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touch his companion 's boot but Stephen , apparently disregard the warm pressure , from an unexpected quarter , answer : —Dedalus . The sailor star at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eye , rather bung up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old Hollands and water . —You know Simon Dedalus ? he ask at length . —I 've hear of him , Stephen say . Mr Bloom be all at sea for a moment , see the others evidently eavesdrop too . —He 's Irish , the seaman bold affirm , star still in much the same way and nodding . All Irish . —All too Irish , Stephen rejoin . As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he be just ask himself what possible connection when the sailor , of his own accord , turn to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark : I see him shoot two egg off two bottle at fifty yard over his shoulder . The left hand dead shot . Though he be slightly hamper by an occasional stammer and his gesture be also clumsy a it be still he do his best to explain . —Bottle Out there , say . Fifty yard measure . Eggs on the bottle . Cocks his gun over his shoulder . Aims . He turn his body half round , shut up his right eye completely , then he screw his feature up some way sideways and glare out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance . —Pom , he then shout once . The entire audience wait , anticipate an additional detonation , there be still a further egg . —Pom , he shout twice . Egg two evidently demolish , he nod and wink , add bloodthirstily : Buffalo Bill shoot to kill , Never miss nor he never will . A silence ensue till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ' sake just felt like ask him whether it be for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley . —Beg pardon , the sailor say . —Long ago ? Mr Bloom pursue without flinch a hairsbreadth . —Why , the sailor reply , relax to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten year . He tour the wide world with Hengler 's Royal Circus . I see him do that in Stockholm . —Curious coincidence , Mr Bloom confide to Stephen unobtrusively . —Murphy 's my name , the sailor continue , W. B. Murphy , of Carrigaloe . Know where that be ? —Queenstown Harbour , Stephen reply . —That 's right , the sailor say . Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle . That 's where I hail from . My little woman 's down there . She 's wait for me , I know . For England , home and beauty . She 's my own true wife I have n't see for seven year now , sail about . Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner 's roadside shieling after have diddle Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon . Across the world for a wife . Quite a number of story there be on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic , Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and do anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary , a favourite and most try declamation piece , by the way , of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in it own small way ? Never about the runaway wife come back , however much devote to the absentee . The face at the window ! Judge of his astonishment when he finally do breast the tape and the awful truth dawn upon him anent his good half , wreck in his affection . You little expect me but I 've come to stay and make a fresh start . There she sit , a grass widow , at the selfsame fireside . Believes me dead . Rocked in the cradle of the deep . And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin , a the case might be , the publican of the Crown and Anchor , in shirtsleeve , eat rumpsteak and onion . No chair for father . Boo ! The wind ! Her brandnew arrival be on her knee , post mortem child . With a high ro ! and a randy ro ! and my gallop tear tandy O ! Bow to the inevitable . Grin and bear it . I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband , W. B. Murphy . The sailor , who scarcely seem to be a Dublin resident , turn to one of the jarvies with the request : —You do n't happen to have such a thing a a spare chaw about you , do you ? The jarvey address , a it happen , have not but the keeper take a die of plug from his good jacket hang on a nail and the desired object be pass from hand to hand . —Thank you , the sailor say . He deposit the quid in his gob and , chew , and with some slow stammer , proceed : —We come up this morning eleven o'clock . The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with brick . I ship to get over . Paid off this afternoon . There 's my discharge . See ? W. B. Murphy , A . B. S. In confirmation of which statement he extricate from an inside pocket and hand to his neighbour a not very clean look folded document . —You must have see a fair share of the world , the keeper remark , lean on the counter . —Why , the sailor answer , upon reflection upon it , I 've circumnavigate a bit since I first join on . I be in the Red Sea . I be in China and North America and South America . I see icebergs plenty , growler . I be in Stockholm and the Black Sea , the Dardanelles , under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttle a ship . I see Russia . Gospodi pomilooy . That 's how the Russians prays . —You see queer sight , do n't be talk , put in a jarvey . —Why , the sailor say , shift his partially chew plug , I see queer thing too , ups and down . I see a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same a I chew that quid . He take out of his mouth the pulpy quid and , lodge it between his teeth , bit ferociously . —Khaan ! Like that . And I see maneaters in Peru that eat corps and the liver of horse . Look here . Here they be . A friend of mine send me . He fumble out a picture postcard from his inside pocket , which seem to be in it way a specie of repository , and push it along the table . The printed matter on it state : Choza de Indios . Beni , Bolivia . All focus their attention on the scene exhibit , at a group of savage woman in striped loincloth , squat , blink , suckle , frowning , sleeping , amid a swarm of infant ( there must have be quite a score of them ) outside some primitive shanty of osier . —Chews coca all day long , the communicative tarpaulin add . Stomachs like breadgraters . Cuts off their diddies when they ca n't bear no more child . See them there stark ballocknaked eat a dead horse 's liver raw . His postcard prove a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorn for several minute , if not more . —Know how to keep them off ? he inquire genially . Nobody volunteer a statement , he wink , say : —Glass . That boggle 'em . Glass . Mr Bloom , without evince surprise , unostentatiously turn over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark . It run a follow : Tarjeta Postal . Señor A. Boudin , Galeria Becche , Santiago , Chile . There be no message evidently , a he take particular notice . Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrate ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depict in Maritana on which occasion the former 's ball pass through the latter 's hat ) , have detect a discrepancy between his name ( assume he be the person he represent himself to be and not sail under false colour after have box the compass on the strict q.t . somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which make him nourish some suspicion of our friend 's bona fides , nevertheless it remind him in a way of a longcherished plan he mean to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travel to London via long sea not to say that he have ever travel extensively to any great extent but he be at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he have consistently remain a landlubber except you call go to Holyhead which be his long . Martin Cunningham frequently say he would work a pas through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally crop up with the net result that the scheme fell through . But even suppose it do come to plank down the needful and break Boyd 's heart it be not so dear , purse permitting , a few guinea at the outside , consider the fare to Mullingar where he figure on go be five and six there and back . The trip would benefit health on account of the brace ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable , especially for a chap whose liver be out of order , see the different place along the route , Plymouth , Falmouth , Southampton and so on , culminate in an instructive tour of the sight of the great metropolis , the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the great improvement tower , abbey , wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with . Another thing just strike him a a by no mean bad notion be he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about try to make arrangement about a concert tour of summer music embrace the most prominent pleasure resort , Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spa , Eastbourne , Scarborough , Margate and so on , beautiful Bournemouth , the Channel island and similar bijou spot , which might prove highly remunerative . Not , of course , with a hole and corner scratch company or local lady on the job , witness Mrs C. P. M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I 'll post you the ticket . No , something top notch , an all star Irish cast , the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with it own legal consort a lead lady a a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners , perfectly simple matter and he be quite sanguine of success , provide puff in the local paper could be manage by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wire and thus combine business with pleasure . But who ? That be the rub . Also , without be actually positive , it strike him a great field be to be open up in the line of open up new route to keep pace with the time apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which , it be moot , be once more on the tapis in the Circumlocution department with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderhead generally . A great opportunity there certainly be for push and enterprise to meet the travel need of the public at large , the average man , i.e . Brown , Robinson and Co . It be a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the system really need tone up , for a matter of a couple of paltry pound , be debar from see more of the world they live in instead of be always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud take me for a wife . After all , hang it , they have their eleven and more humdrum month of it and merit a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime , for choice , when Dame Nature be at her spectacular best , constitute nothing short of a new lease of life . There be equally excellent opportunity for vacationist in the home island , delightful sylvan spot for rejuvenation , offer a plethora of attraction as well a a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and it picturesque environs , even , Poulaphouca , to which there be a steam tram , but also far away from the madding crowd , in Wicklow , rightly term the garden of Ireland , an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen , so long a it do n't come down , and in the wild of Donegal , where if report speak true , the coup d'oeil be exceedingly grand , though the lastnamed locality be not easily getatable so that the influx of visitor be not a yet all that it might be consider the signal benefit to be derive from it , while Howth with it historic association and otherwise , Silken Thomas , Grace O'Malley , George IV , rhododendron several hundred foot above sealevel be a favourite haunt with all sort and condition of men , especially in the spring when young men s fancy , though it have it own toll of death by fall off the cliff by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their left leg , it be only about three quarter of an hour 's run from the pillar . Because of course uptodate tourist travelling be a yet merely in it infancy , so to speak , and the accommodation leave much to be desire . Interesting to fathom , it seem to him , from a motive of curiosity pure and simple , be whether it be the traffic that create the route or vice-versa or the two side in fact . He turn back the other side of the card picture and pass it along to Stephen . —I see a Chinese one time , relate the doughty narrator , that have little pill like putty and he put them in the water and they open , and every pill be something different . One be a ship , another be a house , another be a flower . Cooks rat in your soup , he appetisingly add , the Chinese do . Possibly perceive an expression of dubiosity on their face , the globetrotter go on adhere to his adventure . —And I see a man kill in Trieste by an Italian chap . Knife in his back . Knife like that . Whilst speak he produce a dangerous look clasp knife , quite in keep with his character , and hold it in the striking position . —In a knockingshop it be count of a tryon between two smuggler . Fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him . Like that . Prepare to meet your God , say he . Chuck ! It go into his back up to the butt . His heavy glance , drowsily roam about , kind of defy their further question even should they by any chance want to . That 's a good bit of steel , repeat he , examine his formidable stiletto . After which harrow dénouement sufficient to appal the stout he snap the blade to and stow the weapon in question away a before in his chamber of horror , otherwise pocket . —They 're great for the cold steel , somebody who be evidently quite in the dark say for the benefit of them all . That be why they think the park murder of the invincibles be do by foreigner on account of them use knife . At this remark , pass obviously in the spirit of where ignorance be bliss , Mr Bloom and Stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchange meaning glance , in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however , towards where Skin-the-Goat , alias the keeper , be draw spurt of liquid from his boiler affair . His inscrutable face , which be really a work of art , a perfect study in itself , beggar description , convey the impression that he do n't understand one jot of what be go on . Funny very . There ensue a somewhat lengthy pause . One man be read by fit and start a stain by coffee even journal ; another , the card with the native choza de ; another , the seaman 's discharge . Mr Bloom , so far a he be personally concerned , be just ponder in pensive mood . He vividly recollect when the occurrence allude to take place as well a yesterday , some score of year previously , in the day of the land trouble when it take the civilised world by storm , figuratively speak , early in the eighty , eightyone to be correct , when he be just turn fifteen . —Ay , bos , the sailor break in . Give u back them paper . The request be comply with , he claw them up with a scrape . —Have you see the Rock of Gibraltar ? Mr Bloom inquire . The sailor grimace , chew , in a way that might be read a yes , ay , or no . —Ah , you 've touch there too , Mr Bloom say , Europa point , think he have , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscence but he fail to do so , simply let spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shake his head with a sort of lazy scorn . —What year would that be about ? Mr Bloom interpolate . Can you recall the boat ? Our soi-disant sailor munch heavily awhile , hungrily , before answer . —I 'm tire of all them rock in the sea , he say , and boat and ship . Salt junk all the time . Tired , seemingly , he cease . His questioner , perceive that he be not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , fell to woolgather on the enormous dimension of the water about the globe . Suffice it to say that , a a casual glance at the map reveal , it cover fully three fourth of it and he fully realise accordingly what it mean , to rule the wave . On more than one occasion - a dozen at the low - near the North Bull at Dollymount he have remark a superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seat habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall , star quite obliviously at it and it at him , dream of fresh wood and pasture new a someone somewhere sings . And it leave him wonder why . Possibly he have try to find out the secret for himself , flounder up and down the antipode and all that sort of thing and over and under - well , not exactly under , tempt the fate . And the odds be twenty to nil there be really no secret about it at all . Nevertheless , without go into the minutia of the business , the eloquent fact remain that the sea be there in all it glory and in the natural course of thing somebody or other have to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely go to show how people usually contrive to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance , which be run on identically the same line so that for that very reason , if no other , lifeboat Sunday be a very laudable institution to which the public at large , no matter where living , inland or seaside , -is the case might be , have it bring home to them like that , should extend it gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who have to man the rigging and push off and out amid the element , whatever the season , when duty call Ireland expect that every man and so on , and sometimes have a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forget the Irish light , Kish and others , liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter have experience some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather . —There be a fellow sail with me in the Rover , the old seadog , himself a rover , proceed . Went ashore and take up a soft job a gentleman 's valet at six quid a month . Them be his trouser I 've on me and he give me an oilskin and that jackknife . I 'm game for that job , shave and brushup . I hate roam about . There 's my son now , Danny , run off to sea and his mother get him take in a draper 's in Cork where he could be draw easy money . —What age be he ? query one hearer who , by the way , see from the side , bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell , the townclerk , away from the cark care of office , unwashed , of course , and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage . —Why , the sailor answer with a slow puzzle utterance . My son Danny ? He 'd be about eighteen now , way I figure it . The Skibbereen father hereupon tear open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hand and scratch away at his chest on which be to be see an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink , intend to represent an anchor . —There be louse in that bunk in Bridgwater , he remark . Sure a nut . I must get a wash tomorrow or next day . It 's them black lad I object to . I hate those bugger . Sucks your blood dry , they do . Seeing they be all look at his chest , he accommodatingly drag his shirt more open so that , on top of the time honour symbol of the mariner 's hope and rest , they have a full view of the figure 16 and a young man 's sideface look frowningly rather . —Tattoo , the exhibitor explain . That be do when we be lie becalm off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name of Antonio do that . There he be himself , a Greek . —Did it hurt much do it ? one ask the sailor . That worthy , however , be busily engage in collect round the someway in his . Squeezing or ... —See here , he say , show Antonio . There he be , curse the mate . And there he be now , he add . The same fellow , pull the skin with his finger , some special knack evidently , and he laugh at a yarn . And in point of fact the young man name Antonio 's livid face do actually look like force smiling and the curious effect excite the unreserved admiration of everybody , include Skin-the-Goat who this time stretch over . —Ay , ay , sigh the sailor , look down on his manly chest . He 's go too . Ate by shark after . Ay , ay . He let go of the skin so that the profile resume the normal expression of before . —Neat bit of work , longshoreman one say . —And what 's the number for ? loafer number two queried . —Eaten alive ? a third ask the sailor . —Ay , ay , sigh again the latter personage , more cheerily this time , with some sort of a half smile , for a brief duration only , in the direction of the questioner about the number . A Greek he be . And then he add , with rather gallowsbird humour , consider his alleged end : —As bad a old Antonio , For he leave me on my ownio . The face of a streetwalker , glaze and haggard under a black straw hat , peer askew round the door of the shelter , palpably reconnoitre on her own with the object of bring more grist to her mill . Mr Bloom , scarcely know which way to look , turn away on the moment , flusterfied but outwardly calm , and pick up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he be , have lay aside , he pick it up and look at the pink of the paper though why pink ? His reason for so do be he recognise on the moment round the door the same face he have catch a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane , who know the lady in the brown costume do be with you ( Mrs B . ) , and beg the chance of his washing . Also why washing , which seem rather vague than not ? Your washing . Still , candour compel him to admit that he have wash his wife 's undergarment when soil in Holles Street and woman would and do too a man 's similar garment initial with Bewley and Draper 's marking ink ( hers be , that be ) if they really love him , that be to say . Love me , love my dirty shirt . Still , just then , be on tenterhook , he desire the female 's room more than her company so it come a a genuine relief when the keeper make her a rude sign to take herself off . Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just catch a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin show that she be not exactly all there , view with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy 's nautical chest and then there be no more of her . —The gunboat , the keeper say . —It beat me , Mr Bloom confide to Stephen , medically I be speak , how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital , reek with disease , can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober sens , if he value his health in the least . Unfortunate creature ! Of course , I suppose some man be ultimately responsible for her condition . Still no matter what the cause be from ... Stephen have not notice her and shrug his shoulder , merely remark : —In this country people sell much more than she ever have and do a roaring trade . Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul . She be a bad merchant . She buy dear and sell cheap . The elder man , though not by any manner of mean an old maid or a prude , say that it be nothing short of a cry scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that woman of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ) , a necessary evil , be not license and medically inspect by the proper authority , a thing he could truthfully state he , a a paterfamilias , be a stalwart advocate of from the very first start . Whoever embark on a policy of that sort , he say , and ventilate the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concern . — You , a a good catholic , he observe , talk of body and soul , believe in the soul . Or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower a such , a distinct from any outside object , the table , let u say , that cup ? I believe in that myself because it have be explain by competent men a the convolution of the grey matter . Otherwise we would never have such invention a X ray , for instance . Do you ? Thus corner , Stephen have to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say : —They tell me on the best authority it be a simple substance and therefore incorruptible . It would be immortal , I understand , but for the possibility of it annihilation by it First Cause , Who , from all I can hear , be quite capable of add that to the number of His other practical joke , corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both be exclude by court etiquette . Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesce in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involve be a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoin : —Simple ? I should n't think that be the proper word . Of course , I grant you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon . But what I be anxious to arrive at be it be one thing for instance to invent those ray Röntgen do , Or the telescope like Edison , though I believe it be before his time , Galileo be the man I mean . The same applies to the law , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such a electricity but it 's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God . —O , that , Stephen expostulate , have be prove conclusively by several of the best known passage in Holy Writ , apart from circumstantial evidence . On this knotty point , however , the view of the pair , pole apart a they be , both in schooling and everything else , with the marked difference in their respective age , clash . —Has be ? the more experienced of the two object , stick to his original point . I 'm not so sure about that . That 's a matter of every man 's opinion and , without drag in the sectarian side of the business , I beg to differ with you in toto there . My belief be , to tell you the candid truth , that those bit be genuine forgery all of them put in by monk most probably or it 's the big question of our national poet over again , who precisely write them , like Hamlet and Bacon , a you who know your Shakespeare infinitely good than I , of course I need n't tell you . Ca n't you drink that coffee , by the way ? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun . It 's like one of our skipper 's brick disguise . Still , no one can give what he have n't get . Try a bit . —Could n't , Stephen contrive to get out , his mental organ for the moment refuse to dictate far . Faultfinding be a proverbially bad hat , Mr Bloom think well to stir , or try to , the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflect with something approach acrimony on the Coffee Palace and it temperance ( and lucrative ) work . To be sure it be a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay do a world of good . Shelters such a the present one they be in run on teetotal line for vagrant at night , concert , dramatic evening , and useful lecture ( admittance free ) by qualify men for the low order . On the other hand , he have a distinct and painful recollection they pay his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy who have be prominently associate with it at one time , a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying . The idea , he be strongly incline to believe , be to do good and net a profit , there be no competition to speak of . Sulphate of copper poison , SO4 or something in some dried pea he remember reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he could n't remember when it be or where . Anyhow , inspection , medical inspection , of all eatable , seem to him more than ever necessary which possibly account for the vogue of Dr Tibble 's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involve . —Have a shot at it now , he venture to say of the coffee after be stir . Thus prevail on to at any rate taste it , Stephen lift the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clop out of it when take up - by the handle and take a sip of the offending beverage . —Still , it 's solid food , his good genius urge , I 'm a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason be not gormandise in the least but regular meal a the sine qua non for any kind of proper work , mental or manual . You ought to eat more solid food . You would feel a different man . —Liquids I can eat , Stephen say . But oblige me by take away that knife . I ca n't look at the point of it . It remind me of Roman history . Mr Bloom promptly do a suggest and remove the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observe that the point be the least conspicuous point about it . —Our mutual friend 's story be like himself , Mr Bloom , apropos of knife , remark to his confidente sotto voce . Do you think they be genuine ? He could spin those yarn for hour on end all night long and lie like old boot . Look at him . Yet still , though his eye be thick with sleep and sea air , life be full of a host of thing and coincidence of a terrible nature and it be quite within the bound of possibility that it be not an entire fabrication though at first blush there be not much inherent probability in all the spoof he get off his chest be strictly accurate gospel . He have be meantime take stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up , ever since he clap eye on him . Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamen , if a trifle prone to baldness , there be something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggest a jail delivery and it require no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity . He might even have do for his man , suppose it be his own case he tell , a people often do about others , namely , that he kill him himself and have serve his four or five goodlooking year in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who spring from the pen Of our national poet ) who expiate his crime in the melodramatic manner above describe . On the other hand he might be only bluff , a pardonable weakness , because meet unmistakable mug , Dublin resident , like those jarvies wait news from abroad , would tempt any ancient mariner who sail the ocean sea to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera . And when all be say and do , the lie a fellow told about himself could n't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whopper other fellow coin about him . Mind you , I 'm not say that it 's all a pure invention , he resume . Analogous scene be occasionally , if not often , meet with . Giants , though , that be rather a far cry you see once in a way . Marcella , the midget queen . In those waxwork in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs , a they be call , sit bowlegged . They could n't straighten their leg if you pay them because the muscle here , you see , he proceed , indicate on his companion the brief outline , the sinew , or whatever you like to call them , behind the right knee , be utterly powerless from sit that way so long cramp up , be adore a god . There 's an example again of simple soul . However , revert to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventure ( who remind him a bit of Ludwig , alias Ledwidge , when he occupy the board of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn be identify with the management in the Flying Dutchman , a stupendous success , and his host of admirer come in large number , everyone simply flock to hear him though ship of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat a also do train ) , there be nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he concede . On the contrary , that stab in the back touch be quite in keep with those Italianos , though candidly he be none the less free to admit those ice creamer and frier in the fish way , not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth , over in little Italy there , near the Coombe , be sober thrifty hardworking fellow except perhaps a bit too give to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so a to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and , he add , on the cheap . —Spaniards , for instance , he continue , passionate temperament like that , impetuous a Old Nick , be give to take the law into their own hand and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen . It come from the great heat , climate generally . My wife be , so to speak , Spanish , half , that be . Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she want , have be bear in ( technically ) Spain , i.e . Gibraltar . She have the Spanish type . Quite dark , regular brunette , black . I , for one , certainly believe climate account for character . That 's why I ask you if you write your poetry in Italian . —The temperament at the door , Stephen interpose with , be very passionate about ten shilling . Roberto ruba roba sua . —Quite so , Mr Bloom dittoed . —Then , Stephen say , star and ramble on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere , we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle , Miss Portinari , he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino . —It 's in the blood , Mr Bloom accede at once . All be wash in the blood of the sun . Coincidence , I just happen to be in the Kildare street Museum today , shortly prior to our meeting , if I can so call it , and I be just look at those antique statue there . The splendid proportion of hip , bosom . You simply do n't knock against those kind of woman here . An exception here and there . Handsome , yes , pretty in a way you find , but what I 'm talk about be the female form . Besides , they have so little taste in dress , most of them , which greatly enhance a woman 's natural beauty , no matter what you say . Rumpled stocking - it may be , possibly be , a foible of mine , but still it 's a thing I simply hate to see . Interest , however , be start to flag somewhat all round and the others get on to talk about accident at sea , ship lose in a fog , collision with iceberg , all that sort of thing . Shipahoy , of course , have his own say to say . He have double the Cape a few odd time and weather a monsoon , a kind of wind , in the China sea and through all those peril of the deep there be one thing , he declare , stand to him , or word to that effect , a pious medal he have that save him . So then after that they drift on to the wreck of Daunt 's rock , wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who have really quite a look of Henry Campbell remember it , Palme , on Booterstown Strand , that be the talk of the town that year ( Albert William Quill write a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times ) breaker run over her and crowd and crowd on the shore in commotion petrify with horror . Then someone say something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea , run into by the Mona , which be on an Opposite tack , in rather muggyish weather and lose with all hand on deck . No aid be give . Her master , the Mona 's , say he be afraid his collision bulkhead would give way . She have no water , it appear , in her hold . At this stage an incident happen . It have become necessary for him to unfurl a reef , the sailor vacate his seat . —Let me cross your bow , mate , he say to his neighbour , who be just gently drop off into a peaceful dose . He make track heavily , slowly , with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , step heavily down the one step there be out of the shelter and bore due leave . While he be in the act of get his bearing , Mr Bloom , who notice when he stand up that he have two flask of presumably ship 's rum stick one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it , or unscrew , and , apply it nozzle to his lip , take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise . The irrepressible Bloom , who also have a shrewd suspicion that the old stager go out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female , who , however , have disappear to all intent and purpose , could , by strain , just perceive him , when duly refresh by his rum puncheon exploit , gaze up at the pier and girder of the Loop Line , rather out of his depth , a of course it be all radically alter since his last visit and greatly improve . Some person or person invisible direct him to the male urinal erect by the cleanse committee all over the place for the purpose but , after a brief space of time during which silence reign supreme , the sailor , evidently give it a wide berth , ease himself close at hand , the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splash on the ground where it apparently wake a horse of the cabrank . A hoof scoop anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingle . Slightly disturb in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke , the watcher of the corporation , who , though now break down and fast break up , be none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rate , give the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability , from dictate of humanity , know him before - shift about and shuffle in his box before compose his limb again in the arm of Morpheus . A truly amaze piece of hard time in it most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connect and familiarise with decent home comfort all his life who come in for a cool # 100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled as proceed to make general duck and drake of . And there he be at the end of his tether after have often paint the town tolerably pink , without a beggarly stiver . He drink , needless to be tell , and it point only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if , however - he have contrive to cure himself of his particular partiality . All , meantime , be loudly lament the fall off in Irish shipping , coastwise and foreign as well , which be all part and parcel of the same thing . A Palgrave Murphy boat be put off the way at Alexandra Basin , the only launch that year . Right enough the harbour be there only no ship ever call . There be wreck and wreck , the keeper say , who be evidently au fait . What he want to ascertain be why that ship run bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme be moot by a Mr Worthington or some name like that , eh ? Ask her captain , he advise them , how much palmoil the British Government give him for that day 's work . Captain John Lever of the Lever line . —Am I right , skipper ? he query of the sailor now return after his private potation and the rest of his exertion . That worthy , pick up the scent of the fagend of the song or word , growl in wouldbe music , but with great vim , some Kind of chanty or other in second or third . Mr Bloom 's sharp ear hear him then expectorate the plug probably ( which it be ) , so that he must have lodge it for the time be in his fist while he do the drinking and make water job and find it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question . Anyhow in he roll after his successful libation-cum-potation , introduce an atmosphere of drink into the soirée , boisterously troll , like a veritable son of a seacook : —The biscuit be as hard a brass , And the beef as salt a Lot 's wife 's arse . O Johnny Lever ! Johnny Lever , O ! After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrive on the scene and , regain his seat , he sink rather than sit heavily on the form provide . Skin-the-Goat , assume he be he , evidently with an axe to grind , be air his grievance in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resource of Ireland , or something of that sort , which he describe in his lengthy dissertation a the rich country bar none on the face of God 's earth , far and away superior to England , with coal in large quantity , six million pound ' worth of pork export every year , ten million between butter and egg , and all the rich drain out of it by England levy tax on the poor people that pay through the nose always , and gobble up the best meat in the market , and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein . Their conversation accordingly become general and all agree that that be a fact . You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil , he state , and there be Colonel Everard down there in Cavan grow tobacco . Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon ? But a day of reckoning , he state crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolise all the conversation - be in store for mighty England , despite her power of pelf on account of her crime . There would be a fall and the great fall in history . The Germans and the Japs be go to have their little lookin , he affirm . The Boers be the beginning of the end . Brummagem England be topple already and her downfall would be Ireland , her Achilles heel , which he explain to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles , the Greek hero - a point his auditor at once seize a he completely grip their attention by show the tendon refer to on his boot . His advice to every Irishman be : stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland . Ireland , Parnell say , could not spare a single one of her son . Silence all round mark the termination of his finale . The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed . —Take a bit of do , bos , retaliate that rough diamond palpably a bit peeve in response to the foregoing truism . To which cold douche , refer to downfall and so on , the keeper concur but nevertheless hold to his main view . —Who 's the best troop in the army ? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogate . And the best jumper and racer ? And the best admiral and general we 've get ? Tell me that . —The Irish for choice , retort the cabby like Campbell , facial blemish apart . —That 's right , the old tarpaulin corroborate . The Irish catholic peasant . He 's the backbone of our empire . You know Jem Mullins ? While allow him his individual opinion , a every man , the keeper add he care nothing for any empire , ours or his , and consider no Irishman worthy of his salt that serve it . Then they begin to have a few irascible word , when it wax hotter , both , needle to say , appeal to the listener who follow the passage of arm with interest so long a they do n't indulge in recrimination and come to blow . From inside information extend over a series of year Mr Bloom be rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion a egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wish for , he be fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbour across the channel , unless they be much big fool than he take them for , rather conceal their strength than the opposite . It be quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarter that in a hundred million year the coal seam of the sister island would be play out and if , a time go On , that turn Out to be how the cat jump all he could personally say on the matter be that a a host of contingency , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it be highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both country , even though pole apart . Another little interesting point , the amour of whore and chummies , to put it in common parlance , remind him Irish soldier have a often fight for England a against her , more so , in fact . And now , why ? So the scene between the pair of them , the licensee of the place , rumour to be or have be Fitzharris , the famous invincible , and the other , obviously bogus , remind him forcibly a be on all four with the confidence trick , suppose , that be , it be prearrange , a the lookeron , a student of the human soul , if anything , the others see least of the game . And a for the lessee or keeper , who probably be n't the other person at all , he ( Bloom ) could n't help feeling , and most properly , it be well to give people like that the goby unless you be a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them a a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting , there always be the offchance of a Dannyman come forward and turn queen 's evidence - or king 's now - like Denis or Peter Carey , an idea he utterly repudiate . Quite apart from that , he dislike those career of wrongdoing and crime on principle . Yet , though such criminal propensity have never be an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly do feel , and no deny it ( while inwardly remain what he be ) , a certain kind of admiration for a man who have actually brandish a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political conviction though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing , off the same bat a those love vendetta of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently , after some word pass between the two concern her relation with the other lucky mortal ( the man have have the pair watch ) , inflicted fatal injury on his adored one a a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunge his knife into her until it just strike him that Fitz , nickname Skin-the-Goat , merely drive the car for the actual perpetrator of the outrage and so be not , if he be reliably inform , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , be the plea some legal luminary save his skin on . In any case that be very ancient history by now and a for our friend , the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera , he have transparently outlive his welcome . He ought to have either die naturally or on the scaffold high . Like actress , always farewell - positively last performance then come up smile again . Generous to a fault , of course , temperamental , no economise or any idea of the sort , always snap at the bone for the shadow . So similarly he have a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever get rid of some # . s. d. in the course of his perambulation round the dock in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern , come back to Erin and so on . Then a for the others , he have hear not so long before the same identical lingo , a he tell Stephen how he simply but effectually silence the offender . He take umbrage at something or other , that much injure but on the whole eventempered person declare , I let slip . He call me a jew , and in a heated fashion , offensively . So I , without deviate from plain fact in the least , tell him his God , I mean Christ , be a jew too , and all his family , like me , though in reality I 'm not . That be one for him . A soft answer turn away wrath . He have n't a word to say for himself a everyone saw . Am I not right ? He turn a long you be wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment , with a glance also of entreaty for he seem to glean in a kind of a way that it be n't all exactly . —Ex quibus , Stephen mumble in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eye converse , Christus or Bloom his name be , or , after all , any other , secundum carnem . —Of course , Mr Bloom proceed to stipulate , you must look at both side of the question . It be hard to lay down any hard and fast rule a to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly be though every country , they say , our own distressful include , have the government it deserve . But with a little goodwill all round . It 's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality ? I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form . It never reach anything or stop anything . A revolution must come on the due instalment plan . It 's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular , so to speak . —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minute ' war , Stephen assent , between Skinner 's alley and Ormond market . —Yes , Mr Bloom thoroughly agree , entirely endorse the remark , that be overwhelmingly right and the whole world be overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing . —You just take the word out of my mouth , he say . A hocuspocus of conflict evidence that candidly you could n't remotely . All those wretched quarrel , in his humble opinion , stir up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind , erroneously suppose to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - be very largely a question of the money question which be at the back of everything , greed and jealousy , people never know when to stop . —They accuse - remark he audibly . He turn away from the others , who probably ... and speak near to , so a the others ... in case they ... —Jews , he softly impart in an aside in Stephen 's ear , be accuse of ruin . Not a vestige of truth in it , I can safely say . History - would you be surprise to learn ? - prove up to ' the hilt Spain decay when the Inquisition hound the jew out and England prosper when Cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian , who , in other respect , have much to answer for , import them . Why ? Because they be practical and be prove to be so . I do n't want to indulge in any ... because you know the standard work on the subject , and then , orthodox a you be ... But in the economic , not touch religion , domain , the priest spell poverty . Spain again , you saw in the war , compare with goahead America . Turks , it 's in the dogma . Because if they do n't believe they 'd go straight to heaven when they die they 'd try to live good - at least , so I think . That 's the juggle on which the p.p . 's raise the wind on false pretence . I 'm , he resume , with dramatic force , a good an Irishman a that rude person I tell you about at the outset and I want to see everyone , conclude he , all creed and class pro rata have a comfortable tidysized income , in no niggard fashion either , something in the neighbourhood of # 300 per annum That 's the vital issue at stake and it 's feasible and would be provocative of friendly intercourse between man and man . At least that 's my idea for what it 's worth . I call that patriotism . Ubi patria , a we learn a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater , vita bene . Where you can live well , the sense be , if you work . Over his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee , listen to this synopsis of thing in general , Stephen star at nothing in particular . He could hear , of course , all kind of word change colour like those crab about Ringsend in the morning , burrow quickly into all colour of different sort of the same sand where they have a home somewhere beneath or seem to . Then he look up and saw the eye that say or do n't say the word the voice he hear say - if you work . —Count me out , he manage to remark , mean to work . The eye be surprise at this observation , because a he , the person who own them pro . tem . observe , or rather , his voice speaking do : All must work , have to , together . —I mean , of course , the other hasten to affirm , work in the wide possible sense . Also literary labour , not merely for the kudos of the thing . Writing for the newspaper which be the ready channel nowadays . That 's work too . Important work . After all , from the little I know of you , after all the money expend on your education , you be entitle to recoup yourself and command your price . You have every bit a much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy a the peasant have . What ? You both belong to Ireland , the brain and the brawn . Each be equally important . —You suspect , Stephen retort with a sort of a half laugh , that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice call Ireland for short . —I would go a step far , Mr Bloom insinuate . —But I suspect , Stephen interrupt , that Ireland must be important because it belong to me . —What belong ? queried Mr Bloom , bending , fancy he be perhaps under some misapprehension . Excuse me . Unfortunately I do n't catch the latter portion . What be it you ? ... Stephen , patently crosstempered , repeat and shove aside his mug of coffee , Or whatever you like to call it , none too politely , add : —We ca n't change the country . Let u change the subject . At this pertinent suggestion , Mr Bloom , to change the subject , look down , but in a quandary , a he could n't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sound rather a far cry . The rebuke of some kind be clear than the other part . Needless to say , the fume of his recent orgy speak then with some asperity in a curious bitter way , foreign to his sober state . Probably the home life , to which Mr Bloom attach the utmost importance , have not be all that be needful or he have n't be familiarise with the right sort of people . With a touch of fear for the young man beside him , whom he furtively scrutinise with an air of some consternation remember he have just come back from Paris , the eye more especially remind him forcibly of father and sister , fail to throw much light on the subject , however , he bring to mind instance of cultured fellow that promise so brilliantly , nip in the bud of premature decay , and nobody to blame but themselves . For instance , there be the case of O'Callaghan , for one , the half crazy faddist , respectably connect , though of inadequate mean , with his mad vagary , among whose other gay doings when rotto and make himself a nuisance to everybody all round he be in the habit of ostentatiously sport in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ) . And then the usual dénouement after the fun have go on fast and furious he get land into hot water and have to be spirit away by a few friend , after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard , so a not to be make amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act , certain name of those subpoenaed be hand in but not divulge , for reason which will occur to anyone with a pick of brain . Briefly , put two and two together , six sixteen , which he pointedly turn a deaf ear to , Antonio and so forth , jockey and esthete and the tattoo which be all the go in the seventy or thereabouts , even In the House of Lords , because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other member of the upper ten and other high personage simply follow in the footstep of the head of the state , he reflect about the error of notoriety and crown head run counter to morality such a the Cornwall case a number of year before under their veneer in a way scarcely intend by nature , a thing good Mrs Grundy a the law stand be terribly down on , though not for the reason they think they be probably , whatever it be , except woman chiefly , who be always fiddle more or less at one another , it be largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it . Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should , and every well tailor man must , try to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to act of impropriety between the two , she unbutton his and then he untie her , mind the pin , whereas savage in the cannibal island , say , at ninety degree in the shade not care a continental . However , revert to the original , there be on the other hand others who have force their way to the top from the low rung by the aid of their bootstrap . Sheer force of natural genius , that . With brain , sir . For which and far reason he felt it be interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion , though why , he could not exactly tell , be , a it be , already several shilling to the bad , have , in fact , let himself in for it . Still , to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small ... Intellectual stimulation a such be , he felt , from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind . Added to which be the coincidence of meeting , discussion , dance , row , old salt , of the here today and go tomorrow type , night loafer , the whole galaxy of event , all go to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in , especially a the life of the submerged tenth , viz. , coalminers , diver , scavenger , etc. , be very much under the microscope lately . To improve the shin hour he wonder whether he might meet with anything approach the same luck a Mr Philip Beaufoy if take down in write . Suppose he be to pen something out of the common groove ( a he fully intend do ) at the rate of one guinea per column , My Experiences , let u say , in a Cabman 's Shelter . The pink edition , extra sporting , of the Telegraph , tell a graphic lie , lay , a luck would have it , beside his elbow and a he be just puzzle again , far from satisfy , over a country belong to him and the precede rebus the vessel come from Bridgwater and the postcard be address to A. Boudin , find the captain 's age , his eye go aimlessly over the respective caption which come under his special province , the allembracing give u this day our daily press . First he get a bit of a start but it turn out to be only something about somebody name H. du Boyes , agent for typewriter or something like that . Great battle Tokio . Lovemaking in Irish # 200 damage . Gordon Bennett . Emigration swindle . Letter from His Grace William . Ascot Throwaway recall Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall 's dark horse , Sir Hugo , capture the blue riband at long odds . New York disaster , thousand live lose . Foot and Mouth . Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam . So to change the subject he read about Dignam , R.I.P. , which , he reflect , be anything but a gay sendoff . —This morning ( Hynes put it in , of course ) , the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam be remove from his residence , no 9 Newbridge Avenue , Sandymount , for internment in Clasnevin . The deceased gentleman be a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise , after a brief illness , come a great shock to citizen of all class by whom he be deeply regret . The obsequies , at which many friend of the decease be present , be carry out ( certainly Hynes write it with a nudge from Corny ) by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill & Son , 164 North Strand road . The mourner include : Patk . Dignam ( son ) , Bernard Corrigan ( motherinlaw ) , John Henry Menton , solr. , Martin Cunningham , John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora ( must be where he call Monks the dayfather about Keyes 's ad ) , Thomas Kernan , Simon Dedalus , Stephen Dedalus , B . A. , Edward J. Lambert , Cornelius Kelleher , Joseph M ' C . Hynes , L. Boom , C. P. M'Coy , - M'Intosh , and several others . Nettled not a little by L. Boom ( a it incorrectly state ) and the line of bitched type , but tickle to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus , B . A. , who be conspicuous , needless to say , by their total absence ( to say nothing of M'Intosh ) , L. Boom point it out to his companion B . A. , engage in stifle another yawn , half nervousness , not forget the usual crop of nonsensical howler of misprint . —Is that first epistle to the Hebrews , he ask , as soon a his bottom jaw would let him , in ? Text : open thy mouth and put thy foot in it . —It be , really , Mr Bloom say ( though first he fancy he allude to the archbishop till he add about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection ) overjoy to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergast at Myles Crawford 's after all manage the thing , there . While the other be read it on page two Boom ( to give him for the nonce his new misnomer ) whiled away a few odd leisure moment in fit and start with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three , his sidevalue 1,000 sovs. , with 3,000 sovs . In specie add for entire colt and filly , Mr F. Alexander 's Throwaway , b.h . by Rightaway , 5 yr , 9 st 4 lb , Thrale ( W. Lane ) 1 . Lord Howard de Walden 's Zinfandel ( M. Cannon ) 2 . Mr W. Bass 's Sceptre , 3 . Betting 5 to 4 on Zinfandel , 20 to 1 Throwaway ( off ) . Throwaway and Zinfandel stand close order . It be anybody 's race then the rank outsider draw to the fore get long lead , beat lord Howard de Walden 's chestnut colt and Mr W. Bass 's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course . Winner trained by Braine so that Lenehan 's version of the business be all pure buncombe . Secured the verdict cleverly by a length . 1,000 sovs. , with 3,000 in specie . Also run J. de Bremond 's ( French horse Bantam Lyons be anxiously inquire after not in yet but expect any minute ) Maximum II . Different way of bring off a coup . Lovemaking damage . Though that halfbaked Lyons run off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left . Of course , gamble eminently lend itself to that sort of thing though , a the event turn out , the poor fool have n't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick , the forlorn hope . Guesswork it reduce itself to eventually . —There be every indication they would arrive at that , Mr Bloom say . —Who ? the other , whose hand by the way be hurt , say . One morning you would open the paper , the cabman affirm , and read , Return of Parnell . He bet them what they like . A Dublin fusilier be in that shelter one night and say he saw him in South Africa . Pride it be kill him . He ought to have do away with himself or lie low for a time after Committee Room No . 15 until he be his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him . Then they would all to a man have go down on their marrowbone to him to come back when he have recover his sens . Dead he be n't . Simply abscond somewhere . The coffin they bring over be full of stone . He change his name to De Wet , the Boer general . He make a mistake to fight the priest . And so forth and so on . All the same Bloom ( properly so dubbed ) be rather surprise at their memory for in nine case out of ten it be a case of tarbarrels , and not singly but in their thousand , and then complete oblivion because it be twenty odd year . Highly unlikely , of course , there be even a shadow of truth in the story and , even suppose , he think a return highly inadvisable , all thing consider . Something evidently rile them in his death . Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangement be near completion or whether it transpire he owe his death to his have neglect to change his boot and clothes after a wetting when a cold result and fail to consult a specialist he be confine to his room till he eventually die of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight be at an end or quite possibly they be distress to find the job be take out of their hand . Of course nobody be acquaint with his movement even before , there be absolutely no clue a to his whereabouts which be decidedly of the Alice , where art thou order even prior to his start to go under several alias such a Fox and Stewart , so the remark which emanate from friend cabby might be within the bound of possibility . Naturally then , it would prey on his mind a a born leader of men , which undoubtedly he be , and a commanding figure , a sixfooter or at any rate five foot ten or eleven in his stockinged foot , whereas Messrs So-and-So who , though they be n't even a patch on the former man , rule the roost after their redeeming feature be very few and far between . It certainly point a moral , the idol with foot of clay . And then seventytwo of his trusty henchman round on him with mutual mudslinging . And the identical same with murderer . You have to come back - that haunt sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title rôle how to . He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they break up the type in the Insuppressible or be it United Ireland , a privilege he keenly appreciate , and , in point of fact , hand him his silk hat when it be knock off and he say Thank you , excite a he undoubtedly be under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mention between the cup and the lip - what 's breed in the bone . Still , a regard return , you be a lucky dog if they do n't set the terrier at you directly you get back . Then a lot of shillyshally usually follow . Tom for and Dick and Harry against . And then , number one , you come up against the man in possession and have to produce your credential , like the claimant in the Tichborne case , Roger Charles Tichborne . Bella be the boat 's name to the best of his recollection he , the heir , go down in , a the evidence go to show , and there be a tattoo mark too in Indian ink , Lord Bellew , be it ? As he might very easily have pick up the detail from some pal on board ship and then , when get up to tally with the description give , introduce himself with , Excuse me , my name be So-and-So or some such commonplace remark . A more prudent course , Mr Bloom say to the not over effusive , in fact like the distinguish personage under discussion beside him , would have be to sound the lie of the land first . —That bitch , that English whore , do for him , the shebeen proprietor comment . She put the first nail in his coffin . —Fine lump of a woman , all the same , the soi-disant town-clerk , Henry Campbell remark , and plenty of her . I see her picture in a barber 's . Her husband be a captain or an officer . —Ay , Skin-the-Goat amusingly add . He be , and a cottonball one . This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasion a fair amount of laughter among his entourage . As regard Bloom , he , without the faint suspicion of a smile , merely gaze in the direction of the door and reflect upon the historic story which have arouse extraordinary interest at the time when the fact , to make matter bad , be make public with the usual affectionate letter that pass between them , full of sweet nothing . First , it be strictly platonic till nature intervene and an attachment spring up between them , till bit by bit matter come to a climax and the matter become the talk of the town till the staggering blow come a a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however , who be resolve upon encourage his downfall though the thing be public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossom into . Sino their name be couple , though , since he be her declare favourite , where be the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetop , the fact namely , that he have share her bedroom , which come out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill go through the packed court literally electrify everybody in the shape of witness swear to have witness him on such and such a particular date in the act of scramble out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , have gain admittance in the same fashion , a fact that the weekly , addict to the lubric a little , simply coined shoal of money out of . Whereas the simple fact of the case be it be simply a case of the husband not be up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arrive on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , fall a victim to her siren charm and forget home tie . The usual sequel , to bask in the loved one 's smile . The eternal question of the life connubial , needless to say , crop up . Can real love , suppose there happen to be another chap in the case , exist between marry folk ? Though it be no concern of theirs absolutely if he regard her with affection carry away by a wave of folly . A magnificent specimen of manhood he be truly , augment obviously by gift of a high order a compare with the other military supernumerary , that be ( who be just the usual everyday farewell , my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoon , the 18th hussar to be accurate ) , and inflammable doubtless ( the fall leader , that be , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceive a highly likely to carve his way to fame , which he almost bid fair to do till the priest and minister of the gospel a a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherent and his beloved evicted tenant for whom he have do yeoman service in the rural part of the country by take up the cudgel on their behalf in a way that exceed their most sanguine expectation , very effectually cook his matrimonial goose , thereby heap coal of fire on his head , much in the same way a the fabled as 's kick . Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement , all seem a kind of dream . And the come back be the bad thing you ever do because it go without say you would feel out of place a thing always move with the time . Why , a he reflect , Irishtown Strand , a locality he have not be in for quite a number of year , look different somehow since , a it happen , he go to reside on the north side . North or south however , it be just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and simple , upset the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he be say , a she also be Spanish or half so , type that would n't do thing by half , passionate abandon of the south , cast every shred of decency to the wind . —Just bear out what I be say , he with glow bosom say to Stephen . And , if I do n't greatly mistake , she be Spanish too . —The king of Spain 's daughter , Stephen answer , add something or other rather muddle about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onion and the first land call the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly be so and so many . —Was she ? Bloom ejaculate surprised , though not astonish by any mean . I never hear that rumour before . Possible , especially there it be , a she live there . So , Spain . Carefully avoid a book in his pocket Sweets of , which remind him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date , he take out his pocketbook and , turn over the various content rapidly , finally he . —Do you consider , by the by , he say , thoughtfully select a fade photo which he lay on the table , that a Spanish type ? Stephen , obviously address , look down on the photo show a large sized lady , with her fleshy charm on evidence in an open fashion , a she be in the full bloom of womanhood , In even dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than vision of breast , her full lip part , and some perfect teeth , stand near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano , on the rest of which be In old Madrid , a ballad , pretty in it way , which be then all the vogue . Her ( the lady 's ) eye , dark , large , look at Stephen , about to smile about something to be admire , Lafayette of Westmoreland street , Dublin 's premier photographic artist , be responsible for the esthetic execution . Mrs Bloom , my wife the prima donna , Madam Marion Tweedy , Bloom indicate . Taken a few year since . In or about '96 . Very like her then . Beside the young man he look also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimate , be the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and display at an early age remarkable proficiency a a singer have even make her bow to the public when her year number barely sweet sixteen . As for the face , it be a speaking likeness in expression but it do not do justice to her figure , which come in for a lot of notice usually and which do not come out to the best advantage in that getup She could without difficulty , he say , have pose for the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curve of the ... He dwell , be a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in general developmentally because , a it so happen , no later than that afternoon , he have see those Grecian statue , perfectly develop a work of art , in the National Museum . Marble could give the original , shoulder , back , all the symmetry . All the rest , yes , Puritanism . It do though , St Joseph 's sovereign ... whereas no photo could , because it simply be n't art , in a word . The spirit move him , he would much have like to follow Jack Tar 's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minute to speak for itself on the plea he ... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence be , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to . But it be scarcely professional etiquette so , though it be a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season consider , for sunshine after storm ... And he do feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by move a motion . Nevertheless , he sit tight , just view the slightly soiled photo crease by opulent curve , none the bad for wear , however , and look away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increase the other 's possible embarrassment while gauge her symmetry of heave embonpoint . In fact , the slight soiling be only an added charm , like the case of linen slightly soil , good a new , much good , in fact , with the starch out . Suppose she be go when he ? ... I look for the lamp which she tell me come into his mind but merely a a passing fancy of his because he then recollect the morning litter bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with meet him pike hose ( sic ) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apology to Lindley Murray . The vicinity of the young man he certainly relish , educate , distingué , and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of the bunch , though you would n't think he have it in him ... yet you would . Besides he say the picture be handsome which , say what you like , it be , though at the moment she be distinctly stout . And why not ? An awful lot of make-believe go on about that sort of thing involve a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle allege misconduct with professional golfer or the new stage favourite instead of be honest and aboveboard about the whole business . How they be fat to meet and an attachment spring up between the two so that their name be couple in the public eye be tell in court with letter contain the habitual mushy and compromising expression , leave no loophole , to show that they openly cohabit two or three time a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relation , when the thing run it normal course , become in due course intimate . Then the decree nisi and the King 's Proctor to show cause why and , he fail to quash it , nisi be make absolute . But a for that , the two misdemeanants , wrap up a they largely be in one another , could safely afford to ignore it a they very largely do till the matter be put in the hand of a solicitor , who file a petition for the party wrong in due course . He , Bloom , enjoy the distinction of be close to Erin 's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occur in the historic fracas when the fall leader 's - who notoriously stick to his gun to the last drop even when clothe in the mantle of adultery - ( leader 's ) trusty henchman to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrate into the printing work of the Insuppressible or no it be United Ireland ( a by no mean , by the by , appropriate appellative ) and break up the typecases with hammer or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusion from the facile pen of the O'Brienite scribe at the usual mudslinging occupation , reflect on the erstwhile tribune 's private moral . Though palpably a radically alter man , he be still a commanding figure , though carelessly garb a usual , with that look of settle purpose which go a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discover to their vast discomfiture that their idol have foot of clay , after place him upon a pedestal , which she , however , be the first to perceive . As those be particularly hot time in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustain a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap 's elbow in the crowd that of course congregate lodge some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a grave character . His hat ( Parnell 's ) be inadvertently knock off and , a a matter of strict history , Bloom be the man who pick it up in the crush after witness the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he do with the utmost celerity ) who , pant and hatless and whose thought be mile away from his hat at the time , be a gentleman bear with a stake in the country , he , a a matter of fact , have go into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what 's breed in the bone , instill into him in infancy at his mother 's knee in the shape of know what good form be come out at once because he turn round to the donor and thank him with perfect aplomb , say : Thank you , sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to right earlier in the course of the day , history repeat itself with a difference ; after the burial of a mutual friend when they have leave him alone in his glory after the grim task of have commit his remains to the grave . On the other hand what incense him more inwardly be the blatant joke of the cabman and so on , who pass it all off a a jest , laugh immoderately , pretend to understand everything , the why and the wherefore , and in reality not know their own mind , it be a case for the two party themselves unless it ensue that the legitimate husband happen to be a party to it owe to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones , who happen to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position lock in one another 's arm draw attention to their illicit proceeding and lead up to a domestic rumpus and the err fair one beg forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knee and promise to sever the connection and not receive his visit any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygone be bygone , with tear in her eye , though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time , a quite possibly there be several others . He personally , be of a sceptical bias , believe , and do n't make the small bone about say so either , that man , or men in the plural , be always hang around on the wait list about a lady , even suppose she be the best wife in the world and they get on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglect her duty , she choose to be tire of wedded life , and be on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attention on her with improper intent , the upshot be that her affection centre on another , the cause of many liaison between still attractive married woman get on for fair and forty and young men , no doubt a several famous case of feminine infatuation prove up to the hilt . It be a thousand pity a young fellow bless with an allowance of brain , a his neighbour obviously be , should waste his valuable time with profligate woman , who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime . In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right come on the scene but in the interim lady ' society be a conditio sine qua non though he have the grave possible doubt , not that he want in the small to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson ( who be very possibly the particular lodestar who bring him down to Irishtown so early in the morning ) , a to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirk miss without a penny to their name bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walk out lead up to fond lover ' way and flower and choc . To think of him house and homeless , rook by some landlady bad than any stepmother , be really too bad at his age . The queer suddenly thing he pop out with attracted the elder man who be several year the other 's senior or like his father . But something substantial he certainly ought to eat , be it only an eggflip make on unadulterated maternal nutriment or , fail that , the homely Humpty Dumpty boil . —At what o'clock do you dine ? he question of the slim form and tire though unwrinkled face . —Some time yesterday , Stephen say . —Yesterday , exclaim Bloom till he remember it be already tomorrow , Friday . Ah , you mean it 's after twelve ! —The day before yesterday , Stephen say , improve on himself . Literally astound at this piece of intelligence , Bloom reflect . Though they do n't see eye to eye in everything , a certain analogy there somehow be , a if both their mind be travel , so to speak , in the one train of thought . At his age when dabble in politics roughly some score of year previously when he have be a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honour in the Buckshot Foster day he too recollect in retrospect ( which be a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he have a sneaking regard for those same ultra idea . For instance , when the evicted tenant ' question , then at it first inception , bulk largely in people 's mind though , it go without say , not contribute a copper or pin his faith absolutely to it dictum , some of which would n't exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle , at all event , be in thorough sympathy with peasant possession , a voice the trend of modern Opinion , a partiality , however , which , realise his mistake , he be subsequently partially cure of , and even be twit with go a step far than Michael Davitt in the striking view he at one time inculcate a a backtothelander , which be one reason he strongly resent the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clan in Barney Kiernan 's so that he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortal , be it repeated , depart from his customary habit to give him ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though so far a politics themselves be concerned , he be only too conscious of the casualty invariably result from propaganda and display of mutual animosity and the misery and suffer it entail a a foregone conclusion on fine young fellow , chiefly , destruction of the fit , in a word . Anyhow , upon weigh the pro and con , get on for one a it be , it be high time to be retire for the night . The crux be it be a bit risky to bring him home a eventuality might possibly ensue ( somebody have a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash altogether a on the night he misguidedly bring home a dog ( breed unknown ) with a lame paw , not that the case be either identical or the reverse , though he have hurt his hand too , to Ontario Terrace , a he very distinctly remember , have be there , so to speak . On the other hand it be altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he be in some perplexity a to which of the two alternative ... Everything point to the fact that it behove him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all thing consider . His initial impression be that he be a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grow on him someway . For one thing he might n't what you call jump at the idea , if approach , and what mostly worry him be he do n't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , suppose he do entertain the proposal , a it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe , if find suitable . At all event he wind up by conclude , eschew for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of Epps 's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat double into a pillow . At least he would be in safe hand and as warm a a toast on a trivet . He fail to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort be kick up . A move have to be make because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question , who appear to be glue to the spot , do n't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it be highly likely some sponger 's bawdyhouse of retired beauty off Sheriff street low would be the best clue to that equivocal character 's whereabouts for a few day to come , alternately rack their feeling ( the mermaid ' ) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verge on the tropical calculate to freeze the marrow of anybody 's bone and maul their largesized charm betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potation of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for a to who he in reality be let XX equal my right name and address , a Mr Algebra remark passim . At the same time he inwardly chuckle over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his God be a jew . People could put up with be bite by a wolf but what properly rile them be a bite from a sheep . The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles , your God be a jew , because mostly they appear to imagine he come from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo . —I propose , our hero eventually suggest , after mature reflection while prudently pocket her photo , a it 's rather stuffy here , you just come with me and talk thing over . My digging be quite close in the vicinity . You ca n't drink that stuff . Wait , I 'll just pay this lot . The best plan clearly be to clear out , the remainder be plain sailing , he beckon , while prudently pocket the photo , to the keeper of the shanty , who do n't seem to ... —Yes , that 's the best , he assure Stephen , to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else be all more or less . All kind of Utopian plan be flash through his ( Bloom 's ) busy brain . Education ( the genuine article ) , literature , journalism , prize titbit , up to date billing , hydros and concert tour in English watering resort pack with theatre , turn money away , duet in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other thing , no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetop about it and a slice of luck . An opening be all be want . Because he more than suspect he have his father 's voice to bank his hope on which it be quite on the card he have so it would be just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to . The cabby read out of the paper he have get hold of that the former viceroy , earl Cadogan , have preside at the cabdriver ' association dinner in London somewhere . Silence with a yawn or two accompany this thrill announcement . Then the old specimen in the corner who appear to have some spark of vitality leave read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell have leave Euston for the chief secretary 's lodge or word to that effect . To which absorb piece of intelligence echo answer why . - Give u a squint at that literature , grandfather , the ancient mariner put in , manifest some natural impatience . —And welcome , answer the elderly party thus address . The sailor lug out from a case he have a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hook over his nose and both ear . —Are you bad in the eye ? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk query . —Why , answer the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly be a bit of a literary cove in his own small way , star out of sea-green porthole a you might well describe them a , I use goggles read . Sand in the Red Sea do that . One time I could read a book in the dark , manner of speaking . The Arabian Nights ' Entertainment be my favourite and Red a a Rose be She . Thereupon he paw the journal open and pored upon Lord only know what , find drown or the exploit of King Willow , Iremonger have make a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts , during which time ( completely regardless of Ire ) the keeper be intensely occupied loosen an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinch him , a he mutter against whoever it be sell it , all of them who be sufficiently awake enough to be pick out by their facial expression , that be to say , either simply look on glumly or pass a trivial remark . To cut a long story short Bloom , grasp the situation , be the first to rise to his foot so a not to outstay their welcome have first and foremost , be as good a his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , take the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host a a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others be not look to the effect that the amount due be forthcoming , make a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposit unobtrusively in four copper , literally the last of the Mohicans ) he have previously spot on the printed pricelist for all who run to read opposite to him in unmistakable figure , coffee 2d. , confectionery do. , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , a Wetherup use to remark . - Come , he counsel , to close the séance . Seeing that the ruse work and the coast be clear , they leave the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente . Stephen , who confess to still feel poorly and fag out , pause at the , for a moment ... the door to ... —One thing I never understand , he say , to be original on the spur of the moment , why they put table upside down at night , I mean chair upside down on the table In cafe . To which impromptu the never fail Bloom reply without a moment 's hesitation , say straight off : —To sweep the floor in the morning . So say he skip around nimbly , consider frankly , at the same time apologetic , to get on his companion 's right , a habit of his , by the by , the right side be , in classical idiom , his tender Achilles . The night air be certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen be a bit weak on his pin . —It will ( the air ) do you good , Bloom say , mean also the walk , in a moment . The only thing be to walk then you 'll feel a different man . It 's not far . Lean on me . Accordingly he pass his left arm in Stephen 's right and lead him on accordingly . —Yes , Stephen say uncertainly , because he think he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that . Anyhow , they pass the sentrybox with stone , brazier , etc . where the municipal supernumerary , ex-Gumley , be still to all intent and purpose wrap in the arm of Murphy , a the adage have it , dream of fresh field and pasture new . And apropos of coffin of stone , the analogy be not at all bad , a it be in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituency that rat at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the selfsame evict tenant he have put in their holding . So they pass on to chat about music , a form of art for which Bloom , a a pure amateur , possess the great love , a they make track arm-in-arm across Beresford place . Wagnerian music , though confessedly grand in it way , be a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante 's Huguenots , Meyerbeer 's Seven Last Words on the Cross , and Mozart 's Twelfth Mass , he simply revel in , the Gloria in that be to his mind the acme of first class music a such , literally knock everything else into a cocked hat . He infinitely prefer the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such a those Moody and Sankey hymn or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be . He also yield to none in his admiration of Rossini 's Stabat Mater , a work simply abound in immortal number , in which his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy , make a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say greatly add to her other laurel and put the others totally in the shade in the jesuit father ' church in Upper Gardiner street , the sacred edifice be throng to the door to hear her with virtuoso , or virtuoso rather . There be the unanimous opinion that there be none to come up to her and , suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character , there be a generally voice desire for an encore . On the whole , though favour preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description , and Martha , a gem in it line , he have a penchant , though with only a surface knowledge , for the severe classical school such a Mendelssohn . And talk of that , take it for grant he know all about the old favourite , he mention par excellence Lionel 's air in Martha , M'appari , which , curiously enough , he hear , or overheard , to be more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciate , from the lip of Stephen 's respect father , sung to perfection , a study of the number , in fact , which make all the others take a back seat . Stephen , in reply to a politely put query , say he do n't but launch out into praise of Shakespeare 's song , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist Dowland who live in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist , who anno ludendo hausi , Doulandus , an instrument he be contemplate purchase from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch , whom Bloom do not quite recall , though the name certainly sound familiar , for sixtyfive guinea and Farnaby and son with their dux and come conceit and Byrd ( William ) , who play the virginal , he say , in the Queen 's Chapel or anywhere else he find them and one Tomkins who make toy or air and John Bull . On the roadway which they be approach whilst still speak beyond the swing chain , a horse , drag a sweeper , pace on the paven ground , brush a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom be not perfectly certain whether he have catch a right the allusion to sixtyfive guinea and John Bull . He inquire if it be John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk , a it strike him , the two identical name , a a striking coincidence . By the chain , the horse slowly swerve to turn , which perceive Bloom , who be keep a sharp lookout a usual pluck the other 's sleeve gently , jocosely remark : —Our life be in peril tonight . Beware of the steamroller . They thereupon stop . Bloom look at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guinea , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near , so that it seem new , a different grouping of bone and even flesh , because palpably it be a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger , put his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sit on the perch , busy with his thought . But such a good poor brute , he be sorry he have n't a lump of sugar but , a he wisely reflect , you could scarcely be prepare for every emergency that might crop up . He be just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world . But even a dog , he reflect , take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan 's , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face . But it be no animal 's fault in particular if he be build that way like the camel , ship of the desert , distil grape into potheen in his hump . Nine tenth of them all could be cage or train , nothing beyond the art of man bar the bee ; whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator , tickle the small of his back and he see the joke ; chalk a circle for a rooster ; tiger , my eagle eye . These timely reflection anent the brute of the field occupy his mind , somewhat distract from Stephen 's word , while the ship of the street be manoeuvre and Stephen go on about the highly interesting old ... —What 's this I be say ? Ah , yes ! My wife , he intimate , plunge in medias re , would have the great of pleasure in make your acquaintance a she be passionately attach to music of any kind . He look sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen , image of his mother , which be not quite the same a the usual blackguard type they unquestionably have an indubitable hankering after a he be perhaps not that way build . Still , suppose he have his father 's gift , a he more than suspect , it open up new vista in his mind , such a Lady Fingall 's Irish industry concert on the precede Monday , and aristocracy in general . Exquisite variation he be now describe on an air Youth here have End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck , a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from . Even more he like an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voice of siren , sweet murderer of men , which boggle Bloom a bit : Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten . These opening bar he sing and translate extempore . Bloom , nodding , say he perfectly understand and beg him to go on by all mean , which he do . A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boon , which Bloom appreciate at the very first note he get out , could easily , if properly handle by some recognised authority on voice production such a Barraclough and be able to read music into the bargain , command it own price where baritone be ten a penny and procure for it fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable house in the best residential quarter of financial magnate in a large way of business and title people where with his university degree of B . A . ( a huge ad in it way ) and gentlemanly bear to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , be bless with brain which also could be utilise for the purpose and other requisite , if his clothes be properly attend to so a to the good worm his way into their good grace a he , a youthful tyro in- society 's sartorial nicety , hardly understand how a little thing like that could militate against you . It be in fact only a matter of month and he could easily foresee him participate in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivity of the Christmas season , for choice , cause a slight flutter in the dovecote of the fair sex and be make a lot of by lady out for sensation , case of which , a he happen to know , be on record - in fact , without give the show away , he himself once upon a time , if he care to , could easily have . Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no mean to be sneeze at , go hand in hand with his tuition fee . Not , he parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform a a walk in life for any lengthy space of time . But a step in the required direction it be beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contain no reflection on his dignity in the small and it often turn in uncommonly handy to be hand a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little help . Besides , though taste latterly have deteriorate to a degree , original music like that , different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue a it would be a decided novelty for Dublin 's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solo foist on a confide public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne . Yes , beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the card in his hand and he have a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city 's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and , book ahead , give a grand concert for the patron of the King street house , give a backerup , if one be forthcoming to kick him upstairs , so to speak , a big if however , with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much fete prince of good fellow . And it need not detract from the other by one iota a , be his own master , he would have heap of time to practise literature in his spare moment when desirous of so do without it clashing with his vocal career or contain anything derogatory whatsoever a it be a matter for himself alone . In fact , he have the ball at his foot and that be the very reason why the other , possess of a remarkably sharp nose for smell a rat of any sort , hung on to him at all . The horse be just then . And later on at a propitious opportunity he purpose ( Bloom do ) , without anyway pry into his private affair on the fools step in where angels principle , advise him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he notice , be prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom 's humble opinion throw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person 's character , no pun intend . The horse have reach the end of his tether , so to speak , halt and , rear high a proud feathering tail , add his quota by let fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoke globe of turd . Slowly three time , one after another , from a full crupper he mire . And humanely his driver wait till he ( or she ) have end , patient in his scythed car . Side by side Bloom , profiting by the contretemps , with Stephen pass through the gap of the chain , divide by the upright , and , step over a strand of mire , go across towards Gardiner street lower , Stephen sing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad . Und alle Schiffe brücken . The driver never say a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watch the two figure , a he sit on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , to be marry by Father Maher . As they walk they at time stop and walk again continue their téte à téte ( which , of course , he be utterly out of ) about sirens enemy of man 's reason , mingle with a number of other topic of the same category , usurper , historical case of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case could n't possibly hear because they be too far simply sat in his seat near the end of low Gardiner street and look after their lowbacked car.2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\n"
